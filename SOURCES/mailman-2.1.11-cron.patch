+# ------------------  EDIT THE CORRECT FILE  -------------------------
+# 
+# This file is copied to /etc/cron.d/mailman from
+# @prefix@/cron/crontab.in when the mailman service is started via its
+# init.d script and the file /etc/cron.d/mailman is removed when the
+# service is stopped.  Therefore any edits made directly to
+# /etc/cron.d/mailman will be lost anytime the mailman service
+# restarts.
+#
+# To make changes edit the master copy @prefix@/cron/crontab.in and then
+# restart the service to pick up the changes (/sbin/service mailman restart).
+#
+# The reason this is done this way is because the mailman cron jobs
+# should only be invoked if the mailman service is enabled and not
+# just as a consequence of installing the rpm as was the case
+# previously. The file /etc/cron.d/mailman cannot simply be linked to
+# the master copy in @prefix@/cron because for security reasons cron
+# will not process crontab files that are links or writeable by
+# anybody else but root, thus the file must be copied into /etc/cron.d
+# with the right ownership and permissions.

 # At 8AM every day, mail reminders to admins as to pending requests.
